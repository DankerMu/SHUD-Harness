## Purpose

Define executable engineering checks whose success accurately describes the delivered code surfaces covered by the repository's default local and continuous-integration gate.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Root production scripts participate in blocking typecheck

The default typecheck command SHALL compile production TypeScript scripts under scripts with the repository's unchanged strict base compiler settings, in addition to existing package checks. Script compilation SHALL emit no build artifacts and SHALL resolve Node types from an explicit root dependency aligned with the existing package version. This addition SHALL NOT include test/fixture entrypoints or expand the package test typechecking surface.

#### Scenario: Script strict-null error blocks the default gate

- **WHEN** a production script contains a strict nullability violation
- **THEN** the default typecheck command exits nonzero and reports that script's file and location
- **AND** after restoring valid source the default command succeeds

#### Scenario: Frozen dependency installation supports script checks

- **WHEN** dependencies are installed using the committed frozen lockfile
- **THEN** script compiler Node types resolve without sibling-package path overrides, existing package checks still run, and no script JavaScript/declaration build artifacts are emitted

#### Scenario: Test fixtures stay outside the new program

- **WHEN** a TypeScript test or fixture exists under the scripts tree
- **THEN** it is not added as an entrypoint of the production script compiler program and the existing package test exclusions remain unchanged
